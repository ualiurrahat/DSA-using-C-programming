Algorithms and Data Structures in C
This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures in C language. Each implementation is designed to be clear, efficient, and well-documented.

Algorithms
Binary Search

Implementation of the binary search algorithm for efficient searching in a sorted array.
Linear Search

Simple implementation of the linear search algorithm for searching elements in an array sequentially.
Quick Sort

Efficient sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer strategy.
Selection Sort

Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element and puts it in its final position.
Merge Sort

Sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array.
Bubble Sort

Straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Insertion Sort

Sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
Data Structures
Linked List

Implementation of a singly linked list with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Stack

Implementation of a stack data structure with push and pop operations.
Queue

Implementation of a queue data structure with enqueue and dequeue operations.
Binary Tree

Construction and basic operations on a binary tree, including traversal methods.
Heap

Implementation of a binary heap data structure with heapify and heap sort.
Priority Queues

Priority queue implementation using various approaches like binary heap.
Usage
Each directory contains a standalone implementation of the respective algorithm or data structure. Feel free to explore the source code and use it as a reference or directly in your projects.

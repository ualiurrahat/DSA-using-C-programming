# Algorithms and Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures in C language. Each implementation is designed to be clear, efficient, and well-documented.

## Algorithms

1. **Linear Search**

   - Simple implementation of the linear search algorithm for searching elements in an array sequentially.

2. **Binary Search**

   - Implementation of the binary search algorithm for efficient searching in a sorted array.

3. **Quick Sort**

   - Efficient sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer strategy.

4. **Selection Sort**

   - Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element and puts it in its final position.

5. **Merge Sort**

   - Sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array.

6. **Bubble Sort**

   - Straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

7. **Insertion Sort**
   - Sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

## Data Structures

1. **Linked List**

   - Implementation of a singly linked list with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

2. **Stack**

   - Implementation of a stack data structure with push and pop operations.

3. **Queue**

   - Implementation of a queue data structure with enqueue and dequeue operations.

4. **Binary Tree**

   - Construction and basic operations on a binary tree, including traversal methods.

5. **Heap**

   - Implementation of a binary heap data structure with heapify and heap sort.

6. **Priority Queues**
   - Priority queue implementation using various approaches like binary heap.

## Usage

Each directory contains a standalone implementation of the respective algorithm or data structure. Feel free to explore the source code and use it as a reference or directly in your projects.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
